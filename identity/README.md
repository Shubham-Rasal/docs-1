# Identity management

For design context, see:
- [Identity design decisions](design_decision_ids.md).
- [Issuer registry MVP design](issuer_registry.md)

## Issuer Instructions

### Verified Issuance

Setting up an issuer to create DCC credentials involves:
- [Creating an issuer signing key](issuer_key_generation.md)
- Onboarding the issuer into the issuer registry (coming soon)

### Test/Demo Issuance

An easy way to start experimenting with the DCC standard is to use test/demo issuance, which involves use of the did:web method.

Setting up a test/demo DCC credential issuer involves:
- [Creating an issuer signing key](issuer_key_generation.md)
- [Setting up an issuer test/demo issuing identity](issuer_demo_id.md)
